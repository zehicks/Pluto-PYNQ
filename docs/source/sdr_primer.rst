SDR Primer
==========

Software Defined Radio (SDR) is an essential part of modern wireless communications.  SDR systems are flexible and reconfigurable to be compatible with any number of different wireless standards, at the cost of higher power consumption and often being more expensive than single-protocol radios.  SDRs are used in industries such as defense and telecommunications, and also find use by hobbyists and students learning wireless communications and digital signal processing (DSP).  Two common SDR platforms used in the defense industry are the Ettus Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) and the Xilinx RF System-on-Chip (RFSoC).  These platforms are highly capable for prototyping wireless systems using both software and FPGA signal processing, but they are often too expensive for student or hobbyist use.  One of the more popular low-cost SDR platforms for hobbyist and student use is the HackRF One, which is much cheaper than the two previously mentioned platforms, but lacks an FPGA for hardware-accelerated signal processing.
